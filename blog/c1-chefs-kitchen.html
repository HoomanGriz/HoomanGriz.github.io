      I enjoyed Shareef's Fireside Chat. I learned a lot about DBC and I'm actually very excited about the experience. I enjoy challenges and I think that this will be one of the most intensive and hardest things that I've ever done. I am afraid, but its a good kind of fear. It's not so much a fear of failure because I believe that the only way to fail is to stop trying. I don't plan on stopping and I think that that is what scares me. The sheer workload and knowing myself and my inability to let things go without a solution make worried about the amount of time that will consume my life over the next few months. While I think I know what I'm getting myself into, I am sure that its going to be even harder than I imagine. With the kind of curriculum and kind of learning/teaching that I will be experiencing at DBC, pairing with others will be very important. Specifically because I always like to work alone until I have a solution that I can then present to others for feedback. Working with others to solve problems before I have a solution makes me feel like I am taking too long to find the solution. With my learning style, I like to find a solution quickly by logically finding a way to make things work and then perfecting it through testing. At this phase in my life, I do feel very nervous in making a professional change, especially when my business and myself personally, are still growing and still realizing success, but in then end working so incredibly hard for others and not feeling happy or feeling restricted in my creative output will only continue to wear on me. So now is as good as a time as any to make a move. To take a chance. To know that I need a creative outlet and creating code in a tech world will keep me busy and more importantly happy for years to come. I am ready for this next chapter in my life and am excited to to see how great I can be.
