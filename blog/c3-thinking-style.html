    <p>I've learned a lot about myself since in the last 3 weeks. Since enrolling at DevBootcamp, I'm "working" in one way or another over 100 hours a week. That may seem like a lot but....no never mind, it's just a lot. It's an insane amount of time. I feel like I'm in a daze almost every day and I know that I'm not 100% each day, but I keep going. Maybe its how I was raised, maybe it's my stubborness, or maybe it's something else.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, as I was beginning my work at DBC, I was told to research my thinking and learning styles. Specifically my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Gregorc Thinking Style</a>. According to Anthony Gregorc's model, I am mostly a concrete random thinker. That means that I register information directly through my five senses and I take in information as it comes without having to organize it in any fashion.
    </p>
    <p>All of the thinking styles have their pros and cons. Apparently I learn best by using trial and error approaches, when i compete with others, and when I am given the opportunity to work through problems by myself. The things that are hard for me are restrictions and limitations, routines, re-doing things, and having no options.
    </p>
    <p>This all starts to make sense when I do my work. Understanding my strengths AND weaknesses is imperitive in my success and equally as important in my personal growth. That is where the growth vs. fixed mindset comes in. To grow as a person and as a programmer I need to use my understanding of both my strengths and my weaknesses to my advantage. Knowing my strengths is easy, but using my knowledge of my weaknesses to my advantage is a little more difficult. While I do hate routines and "formal reports", I am generally very organized. When I have the time, I use it wisely. I may write a quick to do list instead of a formal plan of action but it has worked for me. And yes, I would hate to write a formal plan of action for anything.
    </p>
    <p>I think that, my natural thinking style aside, I am very flexible in changing things to adapt to certain situations. While I may be Concrete Random naturally, I have always been able to at least temporaraily change the way I work/think to better handle an obstacle. I also do prefer to work alone, but I enjoy hearing other peoples opinion on things. I feel that I can always learn something new from a different approach. I may not use it, but if someone shows me how to do or see something differently, I will always take what I've learned and make it my own. I think that this is what will help me most at DBC. Using what I learn from the staff and cohort mates to create my own code in the future, while starting long lasting relationships. I remember reading somewhere in pre-phase 0 work that code really represents the person/people writing it. Errors in the code are essentially errors in the person. So doing everything on my own would hinder my learning and not give me the best chance at being the best programmer that I can be. I need to learn to work with other more frequently, especially in the early years of my career, to get the most out of my learning. That is what I plan to do at DBC.
