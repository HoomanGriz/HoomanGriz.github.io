  <h2>The Trouble With Tech Is...</h2>
  <h4>May 3, 2015</h4><br/>
  <section>
    <p>We live in a world that is dominated by technology. Over just the last hundred years we have seen incredible innovation and exponential growth in technology. The advancements that have been seen have touched virtually all aspects of our lives. Our computers and phones are smaller, yet more powerful. Our manufacturing has decreased yet our output has increased. We can both create, and unfortunately destroy, in a fraction of the time that it took us before and it has almost exclusively been because of advancements in different facets of the technology sector.
   </p>
   <p>We are, however, at a crossroads. The tech sector was growing because of increased demand and decreased costs to pursue it ironically due to the advancements that the technology itself helped to create. Today where the consumer appetite seems to stay hungry and unsatisfied with anything less than the newest, most desirable toys, we are faced with a dilemma. Can we continue to see the exponential growth that we have realized thus far or are we about to see decline in tech as we saw in the Y2K times?</p>
   <p>To better understand the current state of the industry, we can simply look at the most recent numbers in the tech sector. Consumers seem to bite on anything involving mobile platforms and gadgets. This says something. That people want to always have their new tech with them. With the exception of Elon Musk and his brilliant Tesla battery for the home, almost everybody has jumped on the mobile bandwagon. Employment for mobile programmimg is expeced to increase 39% over the next three alone. That is the largest increase of any industry anywhere. We are standing at the horizon waiting to witness a mobile technology renaissance.</p>
   <p>But, in reality, what does this mean for the tech industry? It means that people want more. The demand is there, and if demand is there, companies will make it happen. The problem is that people are buying toys that they probably don't need in an economy that has yet to break out of its funk. We are seeing decreases in unemployment, the stock market and interest rates are stabilizing, and so is the housing market. But we're not there yet. People want to buy the new iPhone the day it comes out. Even if they bought the last one when it came out...a few months earlier. But with increased costs in consumables, higher gas prices, and increased costs in production for technology, people will inevitably have less cash flow. These are just a few of the flies in the global economic ointment, but you get the idea. As a result, technology as an industry will not see the expected returns from their creations. Here is where the main issue arises. As a result of decreased demand, due to economic slowing, we will see a slowing of innovation as companies begin to invest more money in infrastructure and working, in-market products, while investing less on pricier R&D projects and futures. This is not to say that we will stop seeing really cool and innovative thing coming to market, but rather they will probably be a little less cool than they were intended to be just to save some money. Kind of like us. I guess Congress was right. Businesses are people too...jk. We'll probably have to hold on to our 6 month old iPhone for a few more months to make sure that our rent and car payments keep going in on time but in the end, technology always wins. We'll get that new phone along with the watch that syncs to it and because we're considerate of those around us, the new Bluetooth headphones from the newest rapper, and for good measure we'll have to get the wearable tech that tracks our Crossfit WODs and posts them to the interwebs for the world to bask in the glory that is our lives, connected, through marvelous technology.</p>
