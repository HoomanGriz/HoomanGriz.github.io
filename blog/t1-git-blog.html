      My thoughts on Version Control:
        Version control in the programming world is an extremely invaluable tool utilized to make working on projects easy to review, edit, and test. WHat it does is save  a "version" of your work that you can then review and test. You can have multiple versions addressing the same issues and see which works best, both functionally and aesthetically. You essentially have a save point for your work, allowing you to go back and check what edits, or "commits" did what, when they were created, who created the commit, which file they worked on, and you can even see which lines of code were deleted in red and what was added in green. When working collaboratively with others, version control in a remote will allow everyone working on the same project to see what each person is doing, creating an environment for everyone to effectively work together without even being in the country.

      How Git tracks changes:
        Git tracks changes in three phases. To see what phase you are in, you can type "git status" in your terminal. Git will even give you directions on how to go through the different phases of your status. If you have a new file, git will tell you that the file is untracked. Once you have a file or if you are modifying an existing file, you will have to "add" or "commit" the file to move it to the next stage. A modified file is not staged for a commit so you will have to stage it first. From your terminal you can type "git add (filename)". This will move the file from untracked to the "staged to be committed" phase. Once it is staged you can commit using "git commit -v" to thoroughly describe changes or "git commit -m "(Commit message Here)"" to quickly add the commit.

      The Benefits of Using GitHub To Store Code
        GitHub is a remote repository that will store code globally, allowing others to access (push/pull) files and edit them either on the github.io or locally on their own repository that they have forked from the master GitHub repo. Keeping the repo remote allows each contributor to work locally on their own, testing their code and its effects on the master code without adding to the master code online. This keeps mistakes to a minimum and allows for changes to be easily, more importantly, the changes are easy to review and go back to if needed.
