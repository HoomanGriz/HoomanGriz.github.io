    <p>People often get confused about the margin, border, and padding properties in css. What do they do exactly? How do I use them? WHY WON'T THIS WORK??? Understanding their purpose can help all of us understand how to best use each of these properties to get the results that we're looking for.
    </p>
    <p>To best understand how these are used we have to understand the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.aspbox model" alt="Box Model" /> Box Model </a>. This is how your objects are positioned in css. Each object has an outer margin, a border, a padding, and then the content. Adjusting the properties around the content give us the look and feel that we're looking for in our sites.
    </p>
    <p>Working outward, the padding is the first property surrounding the content. Essentially it clears the area around the content and you can adjust how much space is cleared.
    </p>
    <p>The border property follows, allowing you to create a visible border around the padding and thus the content. You can alter how the border is dispayed using variables like solid, solid black, dashed, 5px, etc. All of these help to customize the borders that you are creating.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the margin is the outermost property of the box model. Essentially it is used to clear the area outside of the border. You can move the content around the page by making the margins have positive and negative values moving them away (+) or towards(-) the stated property. For example, if you type margin-left: -20px, you will move your content closer to the left by 20 pixels.
    </p>
    <p>Using these properties correctly and in unison can greatly affect your productivity. Understanding that they work together and how they work together will help you get there. Check out the W3 Schools article I have linked in the "Box Model" link above and learn more!
