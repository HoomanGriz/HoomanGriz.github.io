  <h1>What Is the Difference Between Arrays and Hashes in Ruby?</h1>
  <h2>DBC Blog Post Phase 0-Unit 1/Week 3</h2>
  <h4>April 25, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Arrays and Hashes are essentially indexed collections of information, or objects, in Ruby. The difference between the two is in what kind of objects are stored and how they are accessed. An array stores numbers, and you can you can access these numbers by where they are in the array. This requires you to know exactly where the integer is in the array to call on it. That becomes increasingly difficult when the array is very large and you have to count how far up or down the array your "key" is.
    </p>
    <p>I mention a "key" because both arrays and hashes work in key-value pairs. For an array, the key is the integer and the value is where the integer is in the array. A hash, on the other hand can have any variety of key value pairs, not just integers but strings and any other object in Ruby. You can define a key and give it a value, something easy to remember, and call on the key when you need it. This makes using hashes much easier than arrays when dealing with very large information collections.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, both arrays and hashes are essential parts of Ruby's information access and collection. While their best uses differ, they are essentially just two sides of the same coin. Learning to best use them to your advantage will make your life easier and probably a little more organized...and that's something all programmers hope for.
